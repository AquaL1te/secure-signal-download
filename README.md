# Why?
For example the [Signal Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/org.signal.Signal) does not verify the hash of the signal-desktop.deb file before extracting. This script may assist in verifying the source of the package before installing/extracting the deb file. This will limit the chances of tempering with the original source files. This script is only meant if APT itself cannot be used.
